            <p>Students often have no idea about how to select project topics and which project topics are already done in previous years which leads to repetition of topics or conflict of ideas. So, the main purpose of this Project gallery website is to help the students to know what all projects have been developed in a particular subject/domain earlier and also to provide suggestions regarding project work.
                Our project will help the students to have a clear idea of the projects that they have chosen and to also guide their way towards their achievement. This website will also allow the students to interact or contact their seniors and ask them any queries regarding projects and project selection. It will make the life of both student and teacher easier. Students can browse through the projects of each semester as well as each subject in that year. They can also view the reports of a particular project to get an idea of how to present it to the teacher.
